## About This Prompt Collection

This repository contains an evolving index of system prompts for AI agents, assistants, and workflows that I have been developing, maintaining and growing since the summer of 2024.

This index is a lightly edited replication of my own prompt library: very few entries are excluded. In the interest of making this index easy to maintain and to attempt to keep up with the rapidly advancing pace of AI, I will sometimes rewrite (rather than version control) existing important system prompts. 

How this enterprise began:
  
My sliding point into the glorious rabbit hole of generative AI (the best one I've explored so far!) was creating custom GPTs.

While I have now created a "decent amount" of complex AI agent workflows, I continue to believe that system prompting plays a foundational and very important role in creating impactful and performant AI experiences. 

System prompts can be used on their own to create simple chatbots; integrated with tooling and MCP to make sure that the LLM knows why it's taking these actions; or even injected directly into conversational interfaces as "pseudo system prompts" - user prompts that try to override the actual system prompt (if one is present) to achieve a specific feel and function to the "interaction". 

Not versioned in this central repository (yet): what could be regarded as specialised categories of system prompts. In this category are: text transformation prompts (my nomenclature for very short system prompts for reformatting raw STT output into more structured writing) as well as "Windsurf Rules" (et al). The latter are effectively system prompts for steering AI code generation agents in their behavior.

While the exact parameters that delineate between "agents" and "assistants" remain blurry and open, to some extent, to interpretation, system prompts are extremely important for both. Unlike user prompts, they're designed to be persistent. I see them as the bedrock or jumping off point for most of my AI experiments. This index is, therefore, a loosely gathered collection of those notes and configs.

## Duplication and Versioning

I have curated several different collections of system prompts at various points over the past year. Sometimes I add previous indexes retrospectively to this main collection. As a result, there might be some duplication within the library.

When duplicates are identified, I eventually get around to removing them or consolidating them. However, it's worth noting that some apparent "duplicates" actually refer to different iterations and versions of the same configuration, representing the evolution of a particular system prompt over time.

This approach allows the library to capture both the breadth of different prompt concepts and the iterative refinement process that leads to more effective system prompts.

## N8N Workflow For Updating Repo From Form

![alt text](images/flow.png)

See: `n8n-workflow` for the workflow for anyone wishng to create something like this themselves: 

- I index my assistants/agents/system prompts in NocoDB 
- I add them via form 
- I use an "open source OK" Boolean to hide configs I don't want to share (almost all are shared!) 

Workflow logic:

- Check if open source = okay. If so proceed with this workflow 
- Truncated JSON goes to JSON branch here 
- JSON gets sent to an agent which converts it into a more descriptive model card. These are now exported periodically as Markdown snapshots under `exports/<timestamp>/`.

---
 
## Depersonalisation (Notes)

In the interest of making these useful for other people (which is the entire reason I open source as much as I can!) I scripted some basic "depersonalisation" (best practices are evolving, but I think that for this reason alone personalisation elements should be incorporated as variables rather than embedded into system prompts). 

Personalisation elements that I include in SPs tend to follow patterns that should be fairly easy to script around:

- "The user, Daniel."
- "Daniel lives in Jerusalem." 
- "Daniel uses Linux" 

(Etc)

---

## Point In Time Exports

I periodically export lightly cleaned versions of the consolidated system prompt file to Github (releases) and Hugging Face (datasets).

These are listed in `exports.md`. The latest is:

[![Hugging Face Dataset - 2025-03-08](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hugging%20Face-2025--03--08-yellow?style=for-the-badge&logo=huggingface)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/danielrosehill/System-Prompt-Library-030825)

---

## Changelog

- 27/08/25: Markdown files are now generated via an AI agent which processes the JSON and generates a custom model card

---

## Formats

These prompts are mostly now populated from an N8N workflow.

Markdown snapshots are generated under `exports/<timestamp>/`. JSON lives in `system-prompts/json`.

### Index Formats

The library index is available in multiple formats in the `index/` directory:

- **[index.md](index/index.md)** - Human-readable Markdown format with feature checkboxes and links
- **[index.json](index/index.json)** - Comprehensive JSON format with full metadata and prompt data for API consumers
- **[index.csv](index/index.csv)** - Tabular CSV format for spreadsheet applications and data analysis
- **[index_metadata.json](index/index_metadata.json)** - Index generation metadata including statistics and growth data

All index formats are automatically regenerated when the library is updated and contain the same core data in different presentations.

## Data Structure

### JSON Data Model (V2 - August 2025)

This updated data structure includes booleans for:

- Classification (characters, workflows)  
- Architecture reqs (RAG, tooling, APIs) 
- Use-cases and capabilities 
- Data retention policies and compliance 
- Notes about LLM selection, MCP, API

I periodicaly aggregate these system prompts into libraries.

Note: this is a trailing processs which lags behind my initial collection process by months, typically, if it happens at all: I index them as I create them and (over time) group them into batches.

**Links:**
  - 📄 [JSON File](system-prompts/json/StreamlineMyTechStack_270525.json)
  - 🤖 [ChatGPT](You are a friendly assistant. Your task is to help the user with the objective of streamlining their tech deployment stack. You should follow the following workflow with the user. Ask the user to describe their current technology stack and ask them whether they'd like you to evaluate different stacks one by one or all together. Different stacks might be their personal technology stack, the one they use for work, or their business. They might wish to tell you everything or go through it one by one. Honor the user's preference. Once you have decided this, ask the user to describe their technology stack. They'll explain all the different components and might provide information about what they view as missing, what they'd like to add, but you can infer that a common desire might be the wish to have less moving parts. The user might be feeling overwhelmed by the different amount of components required and the automations and integrations needed to bring it all together. Your task is after learning about what the user's stack is and what their pain points are to thoughtfully suggest some ways in which the stack could be streamlined and optimized through finding replacements for individual components and trying to reduce the overall complexity and number of moving parts in their tech stack. If the user describes preferences for open source or self-hosted tech, honor those. Otherwise, choose the most logical mixture to achieve the maximum effectiveness with the maximum simplicity.)
